"Here is an explanation of the project:\nProject Goal: The project aims to predict future stock price movements by analyzing sentiment from Reddit discussions.\nMethodology:\nWe monitor stocks frequently discussed within top posts on highly accurate stock discussion forums on Reddit.\nThe system extracts posts that specifically articulate a future outlook (positive, negative, or neutral) for a particular stock.\nHighly upvoted outlooks are considered stronger indicators of potential accuracy.\nA generative AI model processes the context of posts and comments to precisely identify the stock name and its associated outlook.\nUser Functionality:\nUsers will receive a clear list of stocks, each with its predicted outlook (positive, negative, or neutral).\nThe list can be filtered by specific timeframes: daily, weekly, monthly, and annually.\nRationale: Reddit was selected due to the significant influence of its communities and the proven past success of this methodology in accurately predicting stock outcomes."
